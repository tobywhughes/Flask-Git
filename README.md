# Flask-Git [Work in Progress]
A simple site to manage git repositories.  

## Goals
Create a lightweight site to use locally (i.e. to run on a local network Raspberry Pi) to manage several git repositories.  
* List current projects  
* Show recent commits
* "squash" commits
* Push to GitHub
